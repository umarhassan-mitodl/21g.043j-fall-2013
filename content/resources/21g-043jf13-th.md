description: Thumbnail of a photograph of a Chinese New Year celebration in Boston.
  This photo was taken during the Chinese New Year celebration in Boston Chinatown
  in 2012. Boston has one of the oldest Chinatowns in the US, originating with a small
  settlement of Chinese workers in the 1870s. Chinatown is a place where one can find
  old traditions preserved as well as new, emergent forms of culture being created.
  Students in this class participate in a Chinatown Scavenger Hunt that prompts them
  to look for traces of the past, as well as for evidence of new, evolving forms of
  culture or business in this historic community. Image courtesy of Prof. Emma J.
