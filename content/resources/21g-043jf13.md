description: This photo was taken during the Chinese New Year celebration in Boston
  Chinatown in 2012. Boston has one of the oldest Chinatowns in the US, originating
  with a small settlement of Chinese workers in the 1870s. Chinatown is a place where
  one can find old traditions preserved as well as new, emergent forms of culture
  being created. Students in this class participate in a Chinatown Scavenger Hunt
  that prompts them to look for traces of the past, as well as for evidence of new,
  evolving forms of culture or business in this historic community. Image courtesy
