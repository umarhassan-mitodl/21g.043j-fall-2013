Paper 1: Unpacking Stereotypes - Due session 4 - 1250 words
-----------------------------------------------------------

Personal narrative is an important genre in Asian American literature and history. In this class we will read and discuss excerpts from a range of memoirs, life histories, and other personal narratives. Your first assignment is to write a short personal narrative reflecting on your own childhood and adolescent experiences, and your experiences as a student at MIT. Specifically, you should reflect on those experiences that shaped your understanding of the term "Asian American," and on how this understanding changed (or didn't change) after you arrived at MIT.

Paper 3 (Draft) - Due session 19 - 2250 words
---------------------------------------------

This paper will be revised and resubmitted. A separate grade will be assigned for each submission.

In 2012, the Pew Research Center issued a report on "[The Rise of Asian Americans](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2012/06/19/the-rise-of-asian-americans/)," claiming that: "Asian Americans are the highest-income, best-educated and fastest-growing racial group in the United States." This report received much attention in the press, but was sharply criticized by many Asian American organizations and commentators, who contended that the report was inaccurate and one-sided, and that it furthermore perpetuated the model minority myth, contributing to the formation of Asian Americans as an "invisible" or "forgotten minority.” Based on your reading of this report (the original 2012 report and the updated 2013 version) and its critiques, do you believe that the model minority stereotype is, on balance, beneficial or detrimental to Asian Americans?
