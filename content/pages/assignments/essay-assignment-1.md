Prompt
------

Personal narrative is an important genre in Asian American literature and history. In this class we will read and discuss excerpts from a range of memoirs, life histories, and other personal narratives. Your first assignment is to write a short personal narrative reflecting on your own childhood and adolescent experiences, and your experiences as a student at MIT. Specifically, you should reflect on those experiences that shaped your understanding of the term "Asian American," and on how this understanding changed (or didn't change) after you arrived at MIT.\*

Begin by considering the term "Asian American." Who are Asian Americans? What are some of the stereotypes associated with this label? Next, think about the particular regional/historical context that shaped your ideas. Where did you learn these ideas – parents, media, teachers, school, peer groups? Which influences have been the most important in shaping your ideas? In light of your reflections, grapple with the question of whether or not your thinking about these stereotypes has changed during your time at MIT, as you entered a new environment and met new people? Support your ideas with specific details and/or examples from your personal experiences and observations.

In order to do this assignment well, you will probably need to write much more than 1250 words, and then cut back as you revise your draft. Remember, we don't want random jottings, but a carefully considered narrative that traces the trajectory of your thinking. As you write this essay, it will be useful to think about how the memoirists we have read thus far shaped their life stories—how did they structure their narratives and what details did they choose to highlight? What message did they attempt to convey through their life narratives? In what way might you use their narratives as a model? Writing the draft of this essay will help you discover the **central message you would like to communicate** about your experiences.

This essay is an exercise in crafting **personal narrative**, a genre of writing that is generally useful in various academic or professional contexts, including application essays, personal professional statements, and business message development. This paper does not require a thesis. Instead, focus on telling a clear **story**. Work on crafting a structured and fluid narrative, with a clear narrative thread, developing your voice as a writer, establishing a clear **point of view**, and “finding something to say.” (On this challenge see Clark, Dorie. "[Discover Your Personal Narrative](https://hbr.org/2013/06/discover-your-personal-narrative)." _Harvard Business Review_. June 28, 2013.)

_\*Please note that this assignment does **not** necessarily assume that you consider yourself "Asian American" or any other ethnicity. It does presume, however, that you have entered this class with certain ideas about "Asian Americans" in relation to other American ethnic groups._

Checklist
---------

*   In this paper, both the **message** and the **delivery** are important.
*   Above all, it is important to make this paper **interesting**. Have you grabbed the reader's attention in the first paragraph? Do you sustain it?
*   Have you said something **original**? Or have you merely repeated common knowledge, or what you have read? Is the paper **coherent**?
*   Is there a clear **narrative thread** for the reader to follow?
*   By the end of the paper, have you effectively **communicated** "what you have to say"?
*   Does your **concluding** paragraph tie up all loose ends and leaves the reader with a strong impression, or does the paper simply end?
*   **Proofread** your paper: are there grammatical, spelling, formatting or other errors that **distract** the reader and give an **unprofessional** impression of the writer? Are your sentences well structured and clear?
